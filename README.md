Machine Learning Homeworks

1. Home Work 1 - Implementation of KNN and condensed KNN algorithms and using it to predict the labels for character dataset.

2. Home Work 2 - Implementation of PLA and Pseudoinverse algorithms and using it to predict linearly separable dataset generated using generateData function.

3. Home Work 3 - Using MatConvNet and LIBSVM to predict the labels for mnist dataset.

All the homeworks contain a problem statement and writeup that includes the description of algorithms implemented and the discussion of experiments and its results.
